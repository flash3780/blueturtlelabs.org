#About Us
The mission of Blue Turtle Labs is to develop innovative, commercially
competative designs for devices powered by Stirling engines. 

#Strategy
Our strategy is to connect a worldwide network of engineers in a system where
each individual engineer's commitments can be small, but together can perform 
complex engineering assessments required to produce modern, comercially viable
power system design. It's crowdsourcing, for engineering design.

#Open Design
We believe that sharing knowledge benefits all of mankind. While we're
developing systems for the real world, all of our design decisions are published
online. The intent of this is twofold:
1. To advance the state of the art of Stirling engine technology
2. To produce Stirling powered hardware to solve real-world problems
